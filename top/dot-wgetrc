# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.

# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
# is *not* sent by default.

# "-c" option is all about) - especially if it's properly configured.

# Reads that take longer will fail.  Default = 900 seconds.

# downloads.  Wget will use linear backoff, waiting 1 second after the
# first failure, then 2 seconds, etc. up to this value.
