# RFC 3676, colloquially named format=flowed, or just f=f.
# 
# Messages encoded with f=f allow mail clients to safely reflow the
# paragraphs to nicely fit the user's display, whether that display be
# thinner or wider than the sender's original message.  It's also completely
# compatible with mail clients that don't understand format=flowed, which
# will display the message as the sender originally wrapped it.
# 
# The gist of f=f is that messages can have both "soft" and "hard"
# line breaks.  If a line ends with a space, then it's a soft line break.
# The mail client can safely reflow lines separated by a soft line break.
# Without the trailing space, it's a hard line break, which prohibits
# flowing with the next line.  The last line of a paragraph ends with a
# hard line break.  It's also used for text that shouldn't reflow, such
# as code samples.
