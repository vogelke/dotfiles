# The most flexible way to use ttree is to create a separate directory 
# for configuration files and simply use the .ttreerc to tell ttree where
# it is.  
#     cfg = /path/to/ttree/config/directory

# The pre_process option allows you to specify a template file which
# should be processed before each file.  Unsurprisingly, there's also a
# post_process option to add a template after each file.  In the fragment
# above, we have specified that the config template should be used as a
# prefix template.  We can create this file in the lib directory and use
# it to define some common variables, including those web page links we
# defined earlier and might want to re-use in other templates.
