# Curl automatically tries to read the .curlrc file (or _curlrc file
# on win32 systems) from the user's home dir on startup.
#
# The config file could be made up with normal command line switches,
# but you can also specify the long options without the dashes to make
# it more readable.  You can separate the options and the parameter
# with spaces, or with = or :.  Comments can be used within the file.
# If the first letter on a line is a '#'-symbol the rest of the line
# is treated as a comment.
#
# If you want the parameter to contain spaces, you must enclose the
# entire parameter within double quotes (").  Within those quotes,
# you specify a quote as \".
#
# You must specify options and their arguments on the same line.
# White spaces ARE significant at the end of lines, but all white
# spaces leading up to the first characters of each line are ignored.
#
# Prevent curl from reading the default file by using -q as the first
# command line parameter, like:
#     curl -q www.thatsite.com

# Force curl to display a local help page in case of usage error.
