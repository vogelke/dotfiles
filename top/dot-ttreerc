# The most flexible way to use ttree is to create a separate directory 
# for configuration files and simply use the .ttreerc to tell ttree where
# it is.

# Remember that .ttreerc is always processed before any configuration
# file specified with the "-f" option.  Certain options like "lib" can be
# used any number of times and accumulate their values.
#
# Files in the lib directory are added to the INCLUDE_PATH for the
# template processor so that it can locate these files via an INCLUDE,
# PROCESS or WRAPPER directive.  Thus, the lib directory is an excellent
# place to keep template elements such as header, footers, etc., that
# aren't complete documents in their own right.
