# Lynx version 2.2 and beyond supports the use of proxy servers
# that can act as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
# preferable to the older gateway servers.  Each protocol used by
# Lynx can be mapped separately using PROTOCOL_proxy environment
# variables (see Lynx Users Guide).  If you have not set them
# externally, you can set them at run time via this configuration
# file.  They will not override external settings.  The no_proxy
# variable can be used to inhibit proxying to selected regions
# of the Web (see below).  Note that on VMS these proxy variables
# are set as process logicals rather than symbols, to preserve
# lowercasing, and will outlive the Lynx image.

#http_proxy:http://your.proxy.com:8080/

# The no_proxy variable can be a comma-separated list of strings
# defining no-proxy zones in the DNS domain name space.  If a tail
# substring of the domain-path for a host matches one of these
# strings, transactions with that node will not be proxied.

# If AUTO_SESSION is TRUE lynx will save/restore useful information about

# no command-line session switches override this setting.
# This setting is useful only if SESSION_FILE is defined here or in the user's

# SESSION_FILE defines the file name where lynx will store user sessions.
# This setting is used only when AUTO_SESSION is true.
# Note: the default setting will store/resume each session in a different
# folder under same file name (if that is allowed by operating system)
# when lynx is invoked from different directories.
# (The current working directory may be changed inside lynx)
#
# If you want to use the same session file wherever you invoke Lynx,

# SESSION_LIMIT defines maximum number of:  searched strings, goto URLs,
# visited links and history entries which will be saved in session file.  The
# minimum allowed is 1, the maximum is 10000.
#
# For instance, if SESSION_LIMIT is 250, a per-session limit of 250 entries of
# searched strings, goto URLs, visited links and history entries will be saved
# in the session file.
#
# There is no fixed limit on the number of entries which can be restored;
# It is limited only by available memory.
